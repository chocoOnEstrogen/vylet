<h1 style="align: center">Economy Manager Overview</h1>

The Economy Manager is an automated system that manages a dynamic economy. This system adjusts taxes, applies inflation, and manages special economic events like government grants, booms, and recessions. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Key Features

#### 1. **Automatic Economy Management**
   - **Daily Updates:** Every day at midnight, the economy system runs automatically. This includes:
     - Applying taxes to users based on their current balance.
     - Adjusting for inflation to simulate changes in the economy.
     - Modifying market prices of items based on demand and supply.

#### 2. **Taxation System**
   - A base tax rate of 10% is applied to all users.
   - Users with a balance over 10,000 units are taxed an additional 5%.
   - Taxes are deducted from the user's balance and recorded as transactions.

#### 3. **Inflation**
   - Inflation is applied at a fixed rate of 2% every day.
   - This means that users’ balances increase slightly to simulate the effect of inflation in the economy.

#### 4. **Market Price Adjustments**
   - Market item prices are adjusted based on supply and demand:
     - If demand is higher than supply, prices go up.
     - If supply exceeds demand, prices go down.

#### 5. **Random Economic Events**
   - Every 5 days at noon, random events may occur to shake up the economy:
     - **Economic Boom:** Market prices increase by 20%.
     - **Economic Recession:** Market prices decrease by 20%.
     - **Government Grants:** Every user receives a grant of 1000 units.

#### 6. **Government Grants**
   - The system issues a government grant of 1000 units to each user, boosting their balances when a grant event occurs.

#### 7. **Economic Boom & Recession**
   - **Boom:** Increases the prices of all market items by 20%.
   - **Recession:** Reduces market item prices by 20%, creating a challenging economic situation.

### Events in the Economy

The Economy Manager will broadcast various events when important changes happen:

- **Taxes Applied:** When taxes are deducted from a user’s balance, the system will notify how much was taxed and the new balance.
- **Inflation Applied:** Each day, the system applies inflation to all users' balances, slightly increasing them.
- **Market Prices Adjusted:** The system regularly adjusts item prices in the market based on demand and supply.
- **Government Grants Issued:** Periodically, users receive grants to boost their balance.
- **Economic Booms & Recessions:** Special events that impact market prices for a set period, either boosting or reducing them.

### Summary
The Economy Manager ensures that the economy within the game or community remains dynamic and engaging. Users experience daily economic changes, and random events ensure that no two days are the same. Keep an eye on your balance and the market prices as the economy evolves!
